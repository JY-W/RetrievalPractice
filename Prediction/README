Network matrices derived from the gPPI analyses were submitted to subsequent brain-behavior prediction analyses based on machine learning algorithms using the LIBSVM toolbox (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).

In the machine learning-based prediction model, a leave-one-out approach was used to predict individual’s long-term retention outcomes after consolidation. To predict an individual’s long-term retention, we trained a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with the data of remaining individuals.This approach was iterated to compute predicted long-term retention scores for all individuals.

We then calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between predicted and observed scores as the prediction accuracy to represent the strength of the brain-behavior relationship. The statistical significance of prediction accuracy was assessed by a permutation test procedure.For each permutation, we randomly shuffled behavioral scores, and then computed the brain-behavior prediction accuracy. This procedure was iterated 1,000 times in total. Thereafter, permutated prediction values were sorted in a descending order, and the significance p value was computed by dividing the position number that the prediction accuracy located by 1000.
